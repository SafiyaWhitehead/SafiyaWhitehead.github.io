<p>Weight loss is hard! Many people have the drive to balance their caloric intake and their physical activity allowing the pounds to come off with no special diets, fasts, pills or surgery. I have tried several different avenues. Lost a ton of weight and gained it back. So… I am considered getting the vertical gastric sleeve. Weight loss is not guaranteed with this procedure. From my findings this is not the easy way out. It requires the same discipline.</p> 

 <p>There are many things I have picked up throughout my struggle with my weight I plan on using them to make sure that I release these pounds along the way like that it take the body four hours to truly digest a meal and so you shouldn’t go to bed on a full stomach or within 4 hours of bed. This page is to expose my best workout findings. </p> 

<br>My checkin/weigh-ins: Here I will post my weight, and inches
<br>My rules: Habits or tips that have gave me success
<br>Exercise of the day: My favorite moves from different exercise. They will vary. E.g. Cardio, Weight Training and Yoga
