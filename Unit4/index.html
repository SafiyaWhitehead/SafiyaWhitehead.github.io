		<h1><span>One More Time...</span> one woman's journey through weight loss</h1>
		<p>Weight loss is hard! Many people have the drive to balance their caloric intake and their physical activity allowing the pounds to come off with no special diets, fasts, pills or surgery. I have tried several different avenues. Lost a ton of weight and gained it back. So… I am considered getting the vertical gastric sleeve. Weight loss is not guaranteed with this procedure. From my findings this is not the easy way out. It requires the same discipline.</p>

	<section id="overview">
		<p>There are many things I have picked up throughout my struggle with my weight I plan on using them to make sure that I release these pounds along the way like that it take the body four hours to truly digest a meal and so you shouldn’t go to bed on a full stomach or within 4 hours of bed. This page is to expose my best workout findings.</p>
