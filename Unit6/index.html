			<h1><span>One More Time...</span> one woman's journey through weight loss</h1>
			<p>Weight loss is hard! Many people have the drive to balance their caloric intake and their physical activity allowing the pounds to come off with no special diets, fasts, pills or surgery. I have tried several different avenues. Lost a ton of weight and gained it back. So… I am considered getting the vertical gastric sleeve. Weight loss is not guaranteed with this procedure. From my findings this is not the easy way out. It requires the same discipline.</p>
